# Face Recognition
The goal of this project is to detect and locate human faces in a color image and then recognize the face. A set of training images were provided for this purpose.

The objective was to design and implement a face detector in Python and OpenCV that will detect human faces as well as recognize the person based on the trained images provided. The algorithm used to recognize the face is Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm.
